# **Ghumakkad - Travel Planner**

## **Project Overview**
**Ghumakkad** is a web application that simplifies travel planning by providing several helpful features. With this app, users can build custom itineraries, generate packing lists, get travel suggestions, estimate trip budgets, and access real-time weather forecasts. The platform is built to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience, allowing users to manage their trips efficiently.

Key Features:
- **Itinerary Builder**: Customizable trip itineraries with activities, dates, and locations.
- **Packing List Generator**: Personalized packing lists based on trip details.
- **Travel Suggestions**: Get recommendations for popular destinations.
- **Budget Estimator**: Estimate your trip's cost with visual budget breakdowns.
- **Weather Forecast**: View live weather forecasts to help plan your trip accordingly.

## **Technologies Used**
The project is built using modern web development tools and frameworks to provide a smooth user experience:

### **Frontend**
- **React**: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface with a component-based structure.
- **Styled Components**: For writing CSS inside JavaScript, providing scoped and maintainable styling.
- **React Router**: For navigation between the app’s pages (Home, Itinerary Builder, Packing List, etc.).
- **Axios**: To make API requests, particularly for weather data and travel suggestions.

### **Additional Libraries**
- **React Icons**: Enhances the UI with vector icons for a cleaner look.
- **Chart.js**: For visualizing budget estimates in the Budget Estimator feature.
- **Weather APIs**: Fetch real-time weather data to show forecasts and conditions at travel destinations.

## **Special Features**

### **1. Dynamic Itinerary Builder**
- Allows users to add, remove, and edit activities for their trip.
- Auto-adjusts the dates and timelines based on user input.
- The itinerary is editable and responsive across different devices.
  
```jsx
const [itinerary, setItinerary] = useState([]);
const addActivity = (activity) => {
  setItinerary([...itinerary, activity]);
};
```

### **2. Responsive Design**
- The app is fully responsive and adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Includes a hamburger menu for mobile screens and a dynamic layout that adjusts based on screen size.

```jsx
const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 768);
  window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
}, []);
```

### **3. Real-Time Weather Forecast**
- Pulls live data from the OpenWeather API to provide users with up-to-date weather information for their destination.
- Displays temperature, humidity, and weather predictions to help users pack accordingly.

```jsx
const [weatherData, setWeatherData] = useState(null);
const fetchWeather = async (city) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=your_api_key`);
  setWeatherData(response.data);
};
```

### **4. Interactive Packing List**
- Automatically generates packing lists based on trip details (destination, activities, etc.).
- Users can mark items as packed and add custom items.

```jsx
const [packingList, setPackingList] = useState([]);
const addItem = (item) => setPackingList([...packingList, item]);
```

### **5. Budget Estimator with Visuals**
- Allows users to input their planned activities and destinations to estimate trip expenses.
- Displays budget data using interactive pie charts to visually represent the allocation of funds.

```jsx
const [expenses, setExpenses] = useState([]);
const addExpense = (category, amount) => {
  setExpenses([...expenses, { category, amount }]);
};
```

## **Installation Instructions**

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ykadam006/travel-planner.git
cd ghumakkad
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Now, open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## **Lessons Learned**

Throughout the development of **Ghumakkad**, I gained significant insights into React, state management, API integration, and UX/UI design.

1. **Component Reusability**: Breaking down the app into smaller, reusable components made the codebase more manageable and scalable.
2. **State Management**: Using React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state efficiently was crucial, especially for syncing the UI with real-time weather data.
3. **API Integration**: The integration of third-party APIs, like OpenWeather, provided hands-on experience in handling asynchronous requests with Axios.
4. **UX/UI Design**: Implementing responsive design and smooth transitions (with libraries like Framer Motion) improved the overall user experience.
5. **Data Visualization**: Using **Chart.js** for visualizing the budget made the data easier to understand for users.

## **Future Scope**

There are several ways the project could be expanded in the future:
1. **User Authentication**: Adding user accounts to save and manage itineraries.
2. **Collaborative Planning**: Allowing users to share itineraries and work together.
3. **Multi-Language Support**: Expanding the app to support multiple languages.
4. **Integration with Booking Services**: Connecting with hotel, flight, and other booking services.
5. **Advanced Weather Features**: Adding more detailed weather forecasts (e.g., hourly predictions, 7-day forecasts).
6. **AI Travel Assistant**: Using AI to suggest activities or destinations based on user preferences and trip budgets.
